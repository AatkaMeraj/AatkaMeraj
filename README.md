👋 Hi there! I'm Aatka Meraj

👀 What I'm interested in:

**Data Storytelling:** Crafting narratives with data using visualization tools like Tableau and Python Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Machine Learning:** Developing predictive and analytical models to solve real-world problems.

**NLP and Text Analytics:** Exploring the power of language through sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.

**Computer Vision:** Using models to classify, analyze and extract meaningful insights from images using tools like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

🌱 What I'm currently learning:

Python for Data Science.
Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Enhancing my knowledge of SQL optimization for handling large datasets.
Staying updated with AI trends and exploring AutoML tools.

💞️ Collaboration opportunities:
I'm eager to collaborate on:

Open-source data analytics projects.
End-to-end machine learning pipelines.
Real-world applications of NLP, like chatbots or sentiment analyzers.
Any innovative ideas where data can make a difference!
